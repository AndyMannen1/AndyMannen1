Am I trapped in here \n Is this real? I cannot remember \n There was a manuscript it held a key \n A vicious cycle I must not surrender to \n Echo scenes to seek out \n Again and again \n Until I figure it out \n To bring this song to its end",

Devote yourselves!\nWholeheartedly devote yourselves!\nFor every sacrifice weâ€™ve felt\nHave led us to this very moment!\nDevote yourselves! Devote yourselves!\nWholeheartedly devote yourselves!\nSo clear a path and walk through hell toward a future we must tread\nThose who falsify all our days gone by\nAre the enemies of ours, we all must come to hate\nStill I wonder how it sounded hearing all the lies\nAs they all deceived us on that fateful day\nWhat is it we have to learn so that we can finally slay these demons?\nWhether itâ€™s our tactics or the skills we hone -\nWe will use every one and stop at nothing!\nDevote yourselves! Devote yourselves!\nWholeheartedly devote yourselves!\nFor all the efforts we have felt\nHave led us to this very moment!\nDevote yourselves! Devote yourselves!\nWholeheartedly devote yourselves!\nSo seize the day, and walk through hell to claim our triumph with these hands!\nHow is it, these monsters that can never be redeemed\nHave the gall to wear the faces of humanity\nWe made it our mission to eliminate them all\nTill we take back the world again outside our walls\nThought it started long ago, and no one quite remembers\nWho it was that first started our battle for the end\nWe all bear an anger that is unforgettable\nSo mark our words, we will destroy them all!\nI wonder just what final scene in our survival\nMay be waiting along this path of regret?\nBut our victory will bloom a flower for the lives that we all have sacrificed to claim!\nSo for now we seek the promised land beyond paradise\nSo on that day, humanity then remembered\nThe trembling fear of submitting to our foes\nAnd the cold humiliation of a life in a prison -\nLike a cage of birds!\nArrows of fire soar through the twilight of dawn\nNow watch as their wings unfurl!\nWith a blazing trail behind them paving our way to freedom!\nDevote yourselves! Devote yourselves!\nWholeheartedly devote yourselves!\nFor all the hardship we have felt\nHas led us to this very moment!\nDevote yourselves! Devote yourselves!\nWholeheartedly devote yourselves!\nRelease the fleeting lives youâ€™ve held\nAnd carve them into flaming arrows!\nDevote yourselves! Devote yourselves!\nWholeheartedly devote yourselves!\nSo seize the trail and walk through hell to claim our triumph with these hands!",
